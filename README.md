Objective:

This exercise will test your understanding of JavaScript concepts, including variables, arrays, objects, methods, and operations. You will create an interactive JavaScript file to demonstrate these concepts, and upload your work to GitHub. Additionally, you will record a video explaining your implementation.
Instructions:

    HTML File (index.html):
        Create an HTML file that links to a JavaScript file. The file should have a basic structure and include a note instructing users to check the console for outputs.

    JavaScript File (script.js):

        Part 1: Variables and Constants
            Declare and initialize variable for user's age
            Declare and initialize constant for user's height.

        Part 2: Arrays
            Declare an array with three elements representing pet names.
            Add a new element to the array using push() and remove the last element using pop().
            Reverse the array and display the elements in the console.

        Part 3: Objects
            Declare an object representing a car with properties like make, model, and year.
            Update one of the object's properties.
            Add a new property to the object and log the updated object to the console.

    Submission:
        GitHub Repository:
            Upload the index.html and script.js files to a public GitHub repository. Include a README with instructions on how to run the code.
        Video Explanation:
            Record a video explaining:
                Your approach to solving the exercise.
                How each part of the code demonstrates the concepts.
                Outputs shown in the console.
# Instructions to Run

# Open the Project in a Browser
- Download or clone the project files.
- Open `index.html` in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- Ensure `script.js` is in the same directory as `index.html`.

# View the Console Output
- Right-click anywhere on the page.
- Click **"Inspect"** (or press `F12`).
- Go to the **Console** tab to see the JavaScript output.

# Requirements
- A modern web browser with Developer Tools (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
